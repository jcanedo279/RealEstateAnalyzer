## Download GoogleChromeForTesting and make it an executable

GoogleChromeForTesting versions are available at [GoogleChromeLabs](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)
GoogleChromeForTesting 121.0.6167.85 (stable on 02/16/24) is available at:
[121.0.6167.85 ChromeForTesting for Mac Amr64](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/121.0.6167.85/mac-arm64/chrome-mac-arm64.zip)
[121.0.6167.85 ChromeForTesting for Mac X64](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/121.0.6167.85/mac-x64/chrome-mac-x64.zip)
[121.0.6167.85 ChromeForTesting for Win64](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/121.0.6167.85/win64/chrome-win64.zip)

After downloading chrome for testing, rename it so that '.',' ' -> '_', that is periods and spaces are converted to underscores, then make it
executable by running chmod. For example 'GC 121.0.6167.85' can be made an executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x GC_121_0_6167_85.app
```

The driver for this version can be downloaded from GoogleChromeLabs above, additionally a chromedriver for GC 121.0.6167.85 has been included.
